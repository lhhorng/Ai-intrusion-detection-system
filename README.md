# Ai-intrusion-detection-system

## Overview

Our project is centered on developing an integrated intrusion detection system. The primary goal is to create the most effective detection system capable of identifying any type of cyber-attack. At present, our focus is on detecting a range of simple attacks, such as port scans, SYN floods, domain spoofing. The system aims to enhance security measures by providing comprehensive monitoring and early warning capabilities, ultimately contributing to a more robust defence against potential threats.

## Features

- **Real-time Intrusion Detection**: Continuously monitors network traffic to detect suspicious activities as they occur.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Utilizes advanced ML algorithms for accurate anomaly detection and threat classification.
- **Comprehensive Simulation Suite**: Includes five different simulations to test and validate the system's effectiveness in various scenarios.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Provides a simple and intuitive interface for configuring and monitoring the system.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to scale efficiently with network size and complexity.
